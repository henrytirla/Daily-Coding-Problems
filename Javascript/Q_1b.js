/**

This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k,
return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17,
return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Note-toself: As in the python section i will use a Binary tree to solve this problem

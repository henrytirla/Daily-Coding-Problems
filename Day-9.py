"""You are given a string of length n and an integer k. The string can be manipulated
by taking one of the first k letters and moving it to the end of the string.
Write a program to determine the lexicographically smallest string that can be created
after an unlimited number of moves.

For example, suppose we are given the string da i 1 y and k = l. The best we can
create in this case is ailyd.

"""Given an integer array X[] of size n, write a program to find all the leaders in the array X[].
An element is a leader if it is strictly greater than all the elements to its right side.

The last element of an array is a leader by default.
The largest element of an array is also a leader by default.
Suppose all the array elements are unique.
Ordering in the output doesnâ€™t matter.

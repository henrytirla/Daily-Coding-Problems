"""Given an array X[] of size n, we need to find the maximum and minimum elements present in the array. Our algorithm should make the minimum number of comparisons.

Examples
Input: X[] = [4, 2, 0, 8, 20, 9, 2], Output: max = 20, min = 0

Input: X[] = [-8, -3, -10, -32, -1], Output: max = -1, min = -32"""

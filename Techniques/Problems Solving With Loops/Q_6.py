"""Given an array X[] of n integers where n > 1, write a program to return an array product[] such that product[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of X except X[i].

It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array (including the entire array) fits into a 32-bit integer.
We need to solve this problem without using division operations.

# Get product of all other elements
# Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of
# the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one
# at i.
# For example, if our input was [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [ 120,
# 60, 40, 30, 24]. If ourinputwas [3, 2, 1],theexpectedoutputwouldbe [2,
# 3, 6].
# Follow-up: What if you can't use division?

def products(num_array):
   pass

    #grrr Working on solution





print(products([3,2,1]))
